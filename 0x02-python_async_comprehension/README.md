# Python Async Comprehension

This project involves writing asynchronous coroutines to generate random numbers, collect them using async comprehensions, and measure the runtime of parallel async tasks.

## Tasks

1. **Async Generator**: Create a coroutine `async_generator` that yields random numbers asynchronously.
2. **Async Comprehensions**: Create a coroutine `async_comprehension` that collects 10 random numbers using async comprehensions.
3. **Run time for four parallel comprehensions**: Create a coroutine `measure_runtime` that measures the runtime of running `async_comprehension` four times in parallel.
